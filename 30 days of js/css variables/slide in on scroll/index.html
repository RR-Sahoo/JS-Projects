        Kalinga in 261 BC Its territory formed a part of the ancient Kalinga of
        Mahabharat fame. Ashok the Mauryan King of Magadh, invaded Kalinga in
        261 BC and this event has gone down in history as the Great Kalinga war.
        Then the people of Kalinga offered a relentless & dauntless resistance,
        but they lost at last. How desperate was the battle, how bitterly was it
        fought, and how terrible were the results, are known from Ashok’s own
        descriptions.<img src="images/odishi.jpg" class="align-left slide-in" />
        This is what he wrote about the Kalinga war in his thirteenth Rock
        Edict. The country of Kalinga was conquered when King Priyadarshan,
        beloved of the Gods had been anointed eight years. One hundred and fifty
        thousand were there from captured, one hundred thousand were there
        slain, and many times as many died.

        But what was the result? The conquered Kalinga conquered her conqueror.
        This was the last war fought by him after which he became the great
        champion of Buddhism and upheld the values of peace and non-violence.
        The ancient state rose to prominence as a Kingdom under Kharavela , a
        great conquerer and patron of Jainism, in the second half of the Ist
        century B.C. Other great rulers belonged to the Keshari dynasty and the
        Eastern Ganga dynasty who were also great builders. At one time the vast
        kingdom spanned from Ganga to Godavari. The flourishing maritime trade
        with South-East Asian countries i.e. Java, Bornio had brought in a
        golden era of affluence and opulence. 261 BC The Kalinga School of
        architecture flourished from the 7th to 13th century A.D. The most
        important monuments of this period can be seen in and around Bhubaneswar
        and Puri. The Mukteswar Temple is the finest piece of architecture of
        Kalinga. The Lingaraj Temple of Bhubaneswar, the Jagannath Temple of
        Puri above all the world renowned world heritage Sun Temple at Konark is
        the epitome of temple architecture and sculpture. The construction of
        Konark Temple utilized 12 years of state revenue which can be compared
        to the mighty Moghul Empire, which also utilized its resources of 12
        years for building world famous Taj Mahal.

        state Odisha was constituted as a separate province by carving out
        certain portions from the provinces of Bihar, Odisha and Madras. As
        centuries rolled by, Odisha continued to invite heros, Scholars and

        innumerable scholars now lying buried under Buddhist complex at
        Ratnagiri-Lalitgiri-Udayagiri. Jagannnath Various prophets visited
        Odisha, the significant among those visits is the visit of Adi
        Sankaracharya in 9th century to Puri to make it a center of his mission
        and a towering citadel of his spiritual ideology & message. He
        established four monasteries in four corners of Indian Peninsula out of

        philosophy also visited Puri and established the Emar Matha. In the same
        century Jayadev composed his world famous lilting treatise “Gita
        Govinda”. Subsequently in 16th century Sri Chaitanya, the exponent of
        the Bhakti Cult came to Odisha and made Puri his abode for last 18 years
        of his life. His contemporary Pancha Sakha i.e. Sri Jagannath Das, Sri
        Achyutananda Das, Sri Balaram Das, Ananta & Yasobanta were spiritual
